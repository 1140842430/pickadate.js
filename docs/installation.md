The recommended way to install pickadate.js is with a package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). But you don't need one to use the library.

## Auto-install ðŸš€

Pickadate.js is available as a package on npm. So it can be installed with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
# With Yarn:
yarn add pickadate@next

# Or with npm:
npm install --save pickadate@next
```

Once installed, head over to see [the usage guide](usage).

## Self-install ðŸ› 

Pickadate.js is also available in precompiled UMD bundles that define a global variable on the `window` object [based on how it's used](usage).

You can find these [bundles on unpkg](https://unpkg.com/pickadate) in the `builds` folder to use directly with a `<script>` tag.
