Pickadate.js is a composable date & time state management library.

You can use pickadate.js to create your own interfaces for date/time pickers for any rendering engine that can run JavaScript.

Or, just use one of the interfaces baked in:

1. Date-time picker (plain JavaScript)
1. Date-time picker (React DOM)
1. Date-time picker (React Native - coming soon)

Which look generally like this:

<iframe src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/2vj4opzp9n?hidenavigation=1" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;" sandbox="allow-modals allow-forms allow-popups allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe>
